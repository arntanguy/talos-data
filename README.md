This repository is dedicated to use the TALOS robot with the stack-of-tasks.

Specific data were generated to account to some specific problems when generating/planning motion
with the SoT.

For instance in order to avoid using xacro (with ROS) plain URDF were recorded.

Some dummy data were added (rotor inertia) to help the dynamic regularization.

For initial and data validated by PAL-Robotics please see the http://github.com/pal-robotics/talos_robot
repository.
